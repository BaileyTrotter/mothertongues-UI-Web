This Northern Tutchone dictionary is a work in progress. At this time, all entries come from the <a href='https://ynlc.ca/wp-content/uploads/Noun_Dictionary_Northern_Tutchone_Selkirk.pdf' rel='noopener' target='_blank'><i><u>Selkirk Indian Language Noun Dictionary</u></i></a> developed in 1977 by the Yukon Native Languages Project in partnership with speakers Tommy McGinty and Johnson Edwards.<br><br> We are working to add entries from more sources and speakers, and to include audio examples for as many entries as possible. <br><br>The online framework was built using <a href='https://mothertongues.org/' rel='noopener' target='_blank'><u>Mother Tongues Dictionaries</u></a> developed by Aidan Pine. Mother Tongues Dictionaries is an open-source app suite designed for dictionaries of endangered languages. <br><br><b>Introduction to Selkirk People and Our Language</b><br><br>The <a href='http://www.selkirkfn.com' rel='noopener' target='_blank'><u>Selkirk First Nation</u></a> Government and people reside in the rural community of Pelly Crossing Yukon along the Pelly River and at the halfway point between Whitehorse and Dawson City. In English our language is referred to as “Northern Tutchone”, but in our language we often say <b>Dän Kʼí</b>. <b>Dän</b> means “person” or “people” and <b>Kʼí</b> can mean “ways” or “practices”.<br><br>Our people originally lived in the area that is now known as Fort Selkirk. In our language, we are known as <b>Huchá Hudän</b> (Flatland People) because in Fort Selkirk the landscape is flat on both sides of the Yukon River. After the construction of the Klondike Highway in the 1940s, many <b>Huchá Hudän</b> moved to Minto and then later settled in Pelly Crossing. Existing language resources propose that there are at least six documented dialects of our language spoken by Northern Tutchone people. The map below shows traditional Northern Tutchone territory where our language is spoken. <br><img src='https://baileytrotter.github.io/mothertongues-UI-Web/assets/images/map.png' alt='language map'width='246' height='300'><br><br>Although these resources propose that our people speak the “Pelly (Crossing)” dialect or the “Selkirk” dialect (or both), each person has their own way of speaking that is influenced by who their family is, where their family is from and where they have lived. For this reason, in our dictionary we reference the speaker in each entry and instead of their dialect."
