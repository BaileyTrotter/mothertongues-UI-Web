Entries in the online dictionary have been adjusted to reflect the current alphabet we use, whereas the 1977 dictionary was produced using a typewriter and an older version of the writing system.<br><br><img src='https://baileytrotter.github.io/mothertongues-UI-Web/assets/images/noundictionary.png' alt='noun dictionary' width='287' height='350' style='border:2px'><br><br> We are working to add entries from more sources and speakers, and to include audio examples for as many entries as possible. <br><br>The online framework was built using <a href='https://mothertongues.org/' rel='noopener' target='_blank'><u>Mother Tongues Dictionaries</u></a> developed by Aidan Pine. Mother Tongues Dictionaries is an open-source app suite designed for dictionaries of endangered languages. <br><br><b>Introduction to Selkirk People and Our Language</b><br><br>The <a href='http://www.selkirkfn.com' rel='noopener' target='_blank'><u>Selkirk First Nation</u></a> Government and people reside in the rural community of Pelly Crossing Yukon along the Pelly River and at the halfway point between Whitehorse and Dawson City. In English our language is referred to as “Northern Tutchone”, but in our language we often say <b>Dän Kʼí</b>. <b>Dän</b> means “person” or “people” and <b>Kʼí</b> can mean “ways” or “practices”. The following is a translation of the Preamble from the SFN Constitution. The Preamble in English appears below it.<br><br><b>Nákhwän, Huchá Hudän yetsʼechʼī</b><br>We, the Huchá Hudän people<br><br><b>Dän kʼí yotsʼenī tsin dän kʼí zhī datsʼeʼįn nänka, uyī yotsʼédlįn.</b><br>Our language we speak and the things we do on the land, we are born with it<br><br><b>Náyachóʼ kyaktsʼedóʼ ezhät ghwá hatsʼedän</b><br>We follow our elders, that’s how we learn <br><br><b>Dän kʼí sóthän nánän kʼaantsʼetié</b><br>We look after our land good in our way<br><br><b>Dän kʼí yotsʼenī tsin dän kʼí zhī dátsʼeʼįn sóthän kʼaantsʼetié</b><br>We look after our language and culture<br><br><b>Dunyána nakyákadàwʼ</b><br>Next generations following<br><br><b>Dän kʼí, nánänka zhī datsʼeʼįn natsʼįn sóthän</b><br>Our way makes us feel good, everything we do on the land, itʼs good for you<br><br>We, the Selkirk People, in the exercise of our inherent right of self-government, and having aboriginal rights, title and interests since time immemorial in a vast area of land, do herein provide for ourselves a basis for our First Nation, for our law and for our government, in order to assure for ourselves today, and for countless generations in the future, protection of our land and resources, protection of our language and culture, and a life that fulfills our uniqueness as human beings and sustains our well-being.<br><br>Members of our nation descend from two groups of people who lived and traveled on what is now Selkirk First Nation’s territory, as shown on the Council of Yukon First Nations’ map: <br><br> map here <br><br>Huchá Hudän ‘people of the flat country’ speak what we now call the ‘Selkirk dialect’ of our language. Tsékįnnukne Hudän ‘beaver house along the river people’ speak what we now call ‘Pelly dialect’ of our language. Historically, both peoples associated with each other and traveled throughout our traditional territory throughout the seasons. In time, some people settled upriver at Tatl’á Män and others settled at Fort Selkirk once it started to become a town. Later, some of our people traveled upriver to Minto Landing. Once the Klondike Highway was built in the 1940s, our people traveled up and down river to settle along the Pelly River in what we now call ‘Pelly Crossing’. Selkirk First Nation is based in Pelly Crossing, and many of our people live in this community. <br><br>. Existing language resources propose that there are at least six documented dialects of our language spoken by Northern Tutchone people. The map below shows traditional Northern Tutchone territory where our language is spoken. <br><br><img src='https://baileytrotter.github.io/mothertongues-UI-Web/assets/images/map.png' alt='language map'width='492' height='600'><br><i>Source: Yukon Native Language Centre website</i><br><br>Although these resources propose that our people speak the “Pelly (Crossing)” dialect or the “Selkirk” dialect (or both), each person has their own way of speaking that is influenced by who their family is, where their family is from and where they have lived. For this reason, in our dictionary we reference the speaker in each entry and instead of their dialect."
