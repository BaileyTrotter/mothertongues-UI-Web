        "text": "The Northern Tutchone language is Indigenous to, and spoken in, communities who live in the central Yukon in Canada. Northern Tutchone is a member of the Dene language family and one of six other Dene languages spoken in the Yukon. These other six languages are: Gwich’in, Hän, Kaska, Southern Tutchone, Tagish and Upper Tanana. All of these languages are related to each other, which means that in theory they all developed from the same language that was spoken by Indigenous peoples living in the Yukon region a long time ago. Although today each of these seven Yukon languages is uniquely different, they still share many of the same grammatical structures, sound patterns, and have similar vocabularies. Northern Tutchone is most closely related to Southern Tutchone, which is spoken just south of Northern Tutchone traditional territory. Even though these two languages are closely related, there are still quite a few differences between them, many of which still need to be identified. <br><br>Northern Tutchone is spoken by Yukon communities who live in and around Beaver Creek, Carmacks, Mayo, Pelly Crossing and Stewart Crossing. It’s also spoken by Northern Tutchone people living in other areas of the Yukon, including Whitehorse. <br><br><b>Who Speaks Northern Tutchone?</b> <br><br>Northern Tutchone is the Indigenous language of: Little Salmon Carmacks First Nation (Carmacks), The First Nation of Na-Cho Nyak Dun (Mayo), Selkirk First Nation (Pelly Crossing), and is spoken by members of White River First Nation (Beaver Creek) and Kwanlin Dün First Nation (Whitehorse). Over the last several decades, these First Nations have supported and promoted Northern Tutchone language through activities that include: instituting language and heritage departments, offering language lessons and other educational programming, participating in language documentation, drafting language strategic plans, and developing learning resources, particularly in collaboration with the Yukon Native Language Centre (YNLC)."
